I call myself *Yogster Bear*, and lately I have been doing **a lot** of thinking about society and the technology that shapes it. So much thinking in fact, that I decided to start this blog to reach out to others who might be having the same concerns and hopes.

I hope you can find some time to read on and see if it resonates with you...

## The rise and fall of the global village

When the Web became mainstream in the 90s, the metaphor of the *"global village"* was often used: We are all global neighbours now, and can interact, organise and do business with each other with total freedom, no matter where we live. There was a sense of optimism and hope. The web was going to break borders and social classes to become a channel for equality and freedom of speech.

It looked good for a short while. However, twenty years later it is becoming apparent we are back to the old status quo, with a few large corporations ruling the Internet and dictating in their own terms how it should be used.

Only this time is different: We are not talking about oil, banks, pharma, food producers and retailers. [These still top the charts overwhelmingly in terms of market capitalisation][1]. We are talking about a new breed of companies that understand that [power is not in money, or information, but in our attention][4]. We are of course talking about mainly tech companies (the [in]famous GAFAM - Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft although I would also include eBay and Alibaba).

What is worryingly different about these companies is that, unlike ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase or Pfizer, they infiltrate every aspect of our lives in search for our precious attention, and in doing so shape our society: From the way we [relate to each other][5], to how we [shop][6], work and play. In their drive to pervade every aspect of our lives, these companies are now bridging the virtual to become ubiquitous, with [driverless cars][7], [flu vaccines][8], [Internet access][9] and [payments][10], just to name a few. All in their drive to keep your attention with them for as long and continually as possible.

## Okay, it's not all doom and gloom

Don't get me wrong - **I am not some sort of [neo-luddite][2]**. I actually work as a software developer! I love the unprecedented rate of innovation that we have been enjoying in the past twenty years or so at the hands of the technology sector. I love how I am able to work remotely, keep up with my friends and family abroad, find rare products and discover interesting people and ideas thanks to Google, Facebook and others. These technologies can be extremely positive, and have the potential to make the world a much better place.

### However...

My main problem with the tech giants is that their purpose is not to help me lead a more effcient, fulfilled and happy life. Their purpose is, and will always be, to make money for their shareholders. That is their top priority. The fact that sometimes they make our life more efficient, fulfilled or happy is a necessity of their business model, a means to an end, not the end itself.

*"So what?"* you might say. *"I don't mind if these companies pervade my life in exchange for their services: They are awesome!"*. If that's what you want, that's fair enough. But remember,  *"If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold"* So if you don't mind your attention being a product being sold to the highest bidder (literally), constantly manipulated to spend just one more minute on Facebook, or Twitter, just so that you might click on an advert and buy some shit you don't need, not even being able to opt out and pay for these services, then please go on. Be my guest. It's just not for me.

What also worries and alienates me is that all these new technologies and platforms are being developed by private companies, and therefore are kept private, proprietary and closed, making it very difficult to move from one platform to another. In this environment competition by smaller companies is near impossible.

Finally, it also means we are losing our virtual public spaces to privately owned digital services; so we are free to relate, shop, work and play, but only according to their terms and conditions, not ours. This is very similar to how we are losing our cities' public spaces - The high streets and market squares where communities gathered - to privately owned shopping centres.

## A new global village

So what's the alternative? I suppose there are as many answers to that question as there are people, but here you have my penny's worth:

My vision is a society made up of many diverse local communities, which organise themselves and collaborate with each other through the use of open-source technology created for their own benefit, not for the benefit of private investors. A bit like the proverbial village we all yearn for: Where we actually know our neighbours, we are all self-reliant, but also interdependent and help each other in times of need, and most services and activities are community-led.

The backbone of this society would be a distributed Internet, with cryptocurrency replacing banks and smart contracts in blockchains replacing middlemen. Where advanced AI helps us make the best long-term decisions (something we're hopeless at) instead of figuring out how to sell us stuff we don't need. Where the sharing economy is truly about sharing within the community. For example:

- A community AirBnB where the proceeds are paid back to the community.
- An Uber run by the community, for the community
- A grocery shopping pool that connect neighbourhoods to local producers, bypassing big supermarket chains
- A distributed library that allows neighbours to lend books to each other transparently
- A network to share portions of food with other neigbours or those in need
- Community coworking spaces
- And a bit further in the future: Pools of driverless vehicles owned and managed by the community

In short, we can have the cake and eat it. We can live in a global, hyperconnected society, reaping the benefits of technological advancement while keeping it human, living in close-knit, self-reliant and interdependent communities.

## So what's this blog going to be about?

I am going to be writing about my journey contributing to create a society like the one I described above. This blog is aimed at anybody to whom the above resonated to. I hope we can generate a healthy debate about the issues above and generate new ideas. I'll be dividing my writing into technical and non-technical posts.

The non-technical posts will be:

- Pseudo-socio-economical ramblings like this post
- About my experiences distributing (mainly de-Googling) my life
- About my experiences trying to create a new global village in my community

The technical posts will be:

- How-to guides to help other distribute theirs
- About distributed services out there for you to use
- About distributed technologies (IPFS, Blockchain, Smart contracts, cryptocurrencies...)

Thanks for reading!
