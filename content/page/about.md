I call myself *Yogster Bear*, and lately I have been doing **a lot** of thinking about society and the technology that shapes it. A good starting point about what I am all about is my first post, ["A new global village"][1]:

>My vision is a society made up of many diverse local communities, which organise themselves and collaborate with each other through the use of open-source technology created for their own benefit, not for the benefit of private investors. A bit like the proverbial village we all yearn for: Where we actually know our neighbours, we are all self-reliant, but also interdependent and help each other in times of need, and most services and activities are community-led.
>
>The backbone of this society would be a distributed Internet, with cryptocurrency replacing banks and smart contracts in blockchains replacing middlemen. Where advanced AI helps us make the best long-term decisions (something we're hopeless at) instead of figuring out how to sell us stuff we don't need. Where the sharing economy is truly about sharing within the community.

I decided to start this blog to reach out to others who might be having the same concerns and hopes. I hope we can generate a healthy debate about the issues above and generate new ideas.

I'll be dividing my writing into [general][5], [technical][6] and [meta][7] posts:

**The [general][5] posts will be:**

- Pseudo-socio-economical ramblings
- About my experiences distributing (mainly de-Googling) my life
- About my experiences trying to create a new global village in my community

**The [technical][6] posts will be:**

- How-to guides to help other distribute their lives
- About distributed services out there for you to use
- About distributed technologies (IPFS, Blockchain, Smart contracts, cryptocurrencies...)

**The [meta][7] posts will be about this blog.** For example, this page is "meta" because I talk about the blog itself.
